Hello, this is Niilo from the lightning chart team.
We'd much appreciate if our product could be appended to the short mention of "great commercial data visualization tools" in your GitHub page.

Currently the line is
> There're also some great commercial libraries, like amchart, anychart, plotly, and highchart.

This pull request changes it to 
> There're also some great commercial libraries, like amchart, anychart, plotly, highchart, and lightning chart.

Lightning chart is a relatively new name in web charts so perhaps it is not yet as widely known as some of the others there, but we have no doubt that this will be changing.

While it is not open-source, we do support non-commercial usage and trials for free.

Thanks for your co-operation.
